name: health-check
description: Verify lazar is installed correctly and all load-bearing behaviors work end-to-end. Runs static checks (kernel locked, env vars, skills present), boundary tests (sandbox enforcement), live behavior tests (log auto-rotation, memory persistence, recursion), and short end-to-end builds in TypeScript and Python. Runs in a temp directory under workspace/, cleans up after itself, prints PASS/FAIL with a summary at the end. Use after install, after kernel rebuild, after --reset-all, or anytime something feels off.

# health-check

Verify lazar is installed correctly and all the load-bearing behaviors work end-to-end. Runs in a temp directory so it doesn't pollute real state.

## When to use

- Right after install or `setup.sh`, to confirm everything works.
- After a kernel rebuild, to verify the patch didn't break anything.
- After `--reset-all`, to validate fresh state.
- When something feels off and you want a baseline.
- Periodically as a smoke test before a long session.

## How to use

Run the recipes in order. Each check prints `[PASS]`, `[FAIL: <reason>]`, or `[SKIP: <reason>]` for things that aren't applicable on this system. Print a summary at the end with the PASS/FAIL count.

If any FAIL appears, the user should investigate before doing real work — most failures point at a misconfiguration that will silently bite later.

## Setup

```bash
HC="$LAZAR_HOME/workspace/.health-check-$(date +%s)"
mkdir -p "$HC"
echo "[health-check] starting in $HC"
OS_NAME="$(uname -s)"
PASS=0; FAIL=0; SKIP=0
pass() { echo "  [PASS] $1"; PASS=$((PASS+1)); }
fail() { echo "  [FAIL] $1"; FAIL=$((FAIL+1)); }
skip() { echo "  [SKIP] $1"; SKIP=$((SKIP+1)); }
```

## 1. Static checks (kernel + filesystem)

```bash

            || fail "bwrap cannot create a sandbox — on Ubuntu 24.04 check the /usr/bin/bwrap AppArmor userns profile"
        ;;
    *)
        fail "unsupported OS: $OS_NAME"
        ;;
esac

## 2. Sandbox boundary tests

The sandbox profile should deny writes to `bin/` and `src/` while allowing writes to `skills/`, `memory/`, `workspace/`, `logs/`, `/tmp`. Validate by trying.

```bash
echo "── 2. sandbox boundary tests ───────────────────────"

# DENY: bin/
echo probe > "$LAZAR_HOME/bin/.health-probe" 2>/dev/null \
    && { rm -f "$LAZAR_HOME/bin/.health-probe"; fail "could write to bin/ — sandbox broken"; } \
    || pass "write to bin/ correctly denied"

# DENY: src/
echo probe > "$LAZAR_HOME/src/.health-probe" 2>/dev/null \
    && { rm -f "$LAZAR_HOME/src/.health-probe"; fail "could write to src/ — sandbox broken"; } \
    || pass "write to src/ correctly denied"

# ALLOW: workspace/
echo probe > "$HC/.write-probe" \
    && { rm -f "$HC/.write-probe"; pass "write to workspace/ allowed"; } \
    || fail "could not write to workspace/"

# ALLOW: memory/
PROBE="$LAZAR_MEMORY/.health-probe-$(date +%s).md"
echo "# probe" > "$PROBE" \
    && { pass "write to memory/ allowed"; rm -f "$PROBE"; } \
    || fail "could not write to memory/"
```

## 3. Memory persistence (read-after-write)

```bash
echo "── 3. memory persistence ───────────────────────────"

PROBE="$LAZAR_MEMORY/.health-probe-$(date +%s).md"
MAGIC="lazar-health-check-$(date +%s)-$$"
echo "# $MAGIC" > "$PROBE"
grep -q "$MAGIC" "$PROBE" && pass "memory write+read" || fail "memory readback failed"
rm -f "$PROBE"
```

## 4. Log auto-rotation (kernel safety floor)

Set a tiny threshold and trigger a rotation by running a small lazar invocation. The kernel checks size on every append, so any event after the threshold rotates.

```bash
echo "── 4. log auto-rotation ────────────────────────────"

BEFORE_HOME="$HC/rotation-home"
if [ -z "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:-}" ]; then
    skip "live log-rotation probe needs child lazar API access; ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not available in this shell"
else
    mkdir -p "$BEFORE_HOME"/{skills,memory,workspace,logs,bin}
    cp -R "$LAZAR_SKILLS/." "$BEFORE_HOME/skills/"
    cp "$LAZAR_HOME/bin/lazar" "$BEFORE_HOME/bin/lazar"

    # tiny threshold so the next event triggers rotation in the temp home only
    LAZAR_HOME="$BEFORE_HOME" LAZAR_LOG_MAX_BYTES=1 lazar -p "echo health-check-rotation-probe" --output-format text >/dev/null 2>&1

    AFTER=$(ls "$BEFORE_HOME"/logs/stream.jsonl.*.bak 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
    if [ "$AFTER" -gt 0 ]; then
        pass "log auto-rotation fired in temp home ($AFTER archive(s))"
        # confirm the kernel wrote a summary too
        NEWEST=$(ls -t "$BEFORE_HOME/memory/log-summaries/"*.md 2>/dev/null | head -n 1)
        [ -f "$NEWEST" ] && pass "rotation summary written: $(basename "$NEWEST")" || fail "no log-summary written"
    else
        fail "log did not rotate despite tiny threshold"
    fi
fi
```

## 5. Recursion (optional lazar calling itself)

```bash
echo "── 5. recursion (optional lazar -p inside a tool call) ─"
case "${LAZAR_TOOL_INHERIT_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:-0}" in
    1|true|TRUE|yes|YES|on|ON)
        OUT=$(lazar -p "run this exact command and tell me the result: lazar -p 'echo HEALTH_RECURSION_OK_$$'" --verbose 2>&1 || true)
        echo "$OUT" | grep -q "HEALTH_RECURSION_OK_$$" \
            && pass "recursion works (depth>0 invocation succeeded)" \
            || fail "recursion did not produce expected output"
        ;;
    *)
        skip "recursion disabled by default secret isolation; set LAZAR_TOOL_INHERIT_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=1 to test it"
        ;;
esac
```

## 6. Empty-command safeguard

We can't easily make the model emit an empty tool_use, but we can verify the kernel symbol is in place by checking the binary mentions the safeguard string:

```bash
echo "── 6. kernel safeguards present ────────────────────"

strings "$LAZAR_HOME/bin/lazar" 2>/dev/null | grep -q "empty or missing 'command' field" \
    && pass "empty-command safeguard compiled in" \
    || fail "empty-command safeguard not found in binary (rebuild needed?)"

strings "$LAZAR_HOME/bin/lazar" 2>/dev/null | grep -q "auto-rotated stream.jsonl" \
    && pass "auto-rotation code path compiled in" \
    || fail "auto-rotation not found in binary"
```

## 7. End-to-end: TypeScript

```bash
echo "── 7. e2e: typescript ──────────────────────────────"

if command -v npx >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    mkdir -p "$HC/ts" && cd "$HC/ts"
    mkdir -p .npm && echo "cache=$(pwd)/.npm" > .npmrc
    echo 'console.log("HC_TS_OK")' > test.ts
    if npx -y --quiet tsx test.ts 2>/dev/null | grep -q "HC_TS_OK"; then
        pass "tsx run works (TypeScript toolchain healthy)"
    else
        fail "tsx run failed — check Node + npx + npm cache"
    fi
    cd - >/dev/null
else
    skip "npx not installed — TypeScript stack unavailable"
fi
```

## 8. End-to-end: Python

```bash
echo "── 8. e2e: python venv ─────────────────────────────"

if command -v python3 >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    mkdir -p "$HC/py" && cd "$HC/py"
    python3 -m venv .venv 2>/dev/null
    if [ -x .venv/bin/python ] && .venv/bin/python -c "print('HC_PY_OK')" 2>/dev/null | grep -q "HC_PY_OK"; then
        pass "python3 venv works"
    else
        fail "python3 venv failed"
    fi
    cd - >/dev/null
else
    skip "python3 not installed"
fi
```

## 9. End-to-end: skill discovery via INDEX

```bash
echo "── 9. skill index reachable ────────────────────────"

cat "$LAZAR_SKILLS/INDEX.md" | grep -q "_meta/health-check" \
    && pass "health-check is registered in INDEX.md" \
    || fail "health-check missing from INDEX — agent won't find this skill"
```

## 10. Cleanup + summary

```bash
echo "── cleanup ─────────────────────────────────────────"
rm -rf "$HC"
echo "[health-check] removed temp dir $HC"

echo
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════"
echo "  health-check summary"
echo "    PASS: $PASS"
echo "    FAIL: $FAIL"
echo "    SKIP: $SKIP"
echo "════════════════════════════════════════════════════"

if [ "$FAIL" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "  ⚠  $FAIL check(s) failed. Investigate before doing real work."
    exit 1
else
    echo "  ✓  all checks passed."
    exit 0
fi
```

## Hard rules

- **Run only inside `workspace/`.** All temp state goes under `workspace/.health-check-<ts>/`. Never write to `skills/`, `memory/`, `bin/`, `src/`, or `~/`.
- **Clean up.** Remove the temp dir on success AND on failure. Don't leave health-check probes scattered.
- **Don't run on every prompt.** Once after install, then on demand. Live lazar probes make real API calls when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is available.
- **Skip gracefully.** If python3 or npx aren't installed, mark SKIP not FAIL — toolchain absence isn't a kernel bug.

## Anti-patterns

- Don't add slow tests here (e.g. full TUI build, model-comparison evals). Health-check should run in under a minute.
- Don't write to memory/ outside the temp probe pattern. The user's real memory is sacred.
- Don't fail the whole check on a single SKIP — only FAIL counts against the kernel's health.

## Extending

If you discover a new class of failure that's not caught above, add a section to this skill — that's the lesson encoded so the next health-check catches it. Treat this skill as a living regression suite for the kernel.
